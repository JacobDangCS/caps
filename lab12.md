# LAB - Class 12

## Project: CAPS Phase 2
Phase 2 requires a refactor using Socket.io libraries. Allowing for communication between server and client applications.

The intent here is to build the data services that would drive a suite of applications where we can see pickups and deliveries in real-time.

### Author: Jacob Dang

### Problem Domain
Given Phase 1 demonstrated how event handling as well as listening works,
